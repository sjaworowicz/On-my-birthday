    <h3 align="right">1897: Amelia Earhart was born</h3>
    <p align="right">Amelia Mary Earhart was an American aviation pioneer and writer. Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She set many other records, was one of the first aviators to promote commercial air travel, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences, and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.</p>

    <h3 align="right">1923: The Treaty of Lusanne is signed</h3>
    <p align="right">The Treaty of Lausanne is a peace treaty negotiated during the Lausanne Conference of 1922–1923 and signed in the Palais de Ruminein Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 July 1923. The treaty officially resolved the conflict that had initially arisen between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied French Republic, British Empire, Kingdom of Italy, Empire of Japan, Kingdom of Greece, Kingdom of Serbia, and the Kingdom of Romania since the outset of World War I. The original text of the treaty is in French. It emerged as a second attempt at peace after the failed and unratified Treaty of Sèvres, which had sought to partition Ottoman territories. The earlier treaty, signed in 1920, was later rejected by the Turkish National Movement which actively opposed its terms. As a result of the Greco-Turkish War, İzmir was reclaimed, and the Armistice of Mudanya was signed in October 1922. This armistice provided for the exchange of Greek-Turkish populations and allowed unrestricted civilian, non-military passage through the Turkish Straits.</p>

    <h3 align="right">1983: New York Yankkes vs Kansas City Royals "pine tar incident"</h3>
    <p align="right">On July 24, 1983, the New York Yankees were playing the Kansas City Royals when George Brett hit a home run while the royals trailing the game 4-3, making them have a 5-4 lead, then the Yankees manager decided for the umpires to check his bat. All the umpires gathered around and measured the bat to make sure the bat didn’t have too much pine tar (which helps players get a better grip of the bat). Once they measured the pine tar, there was too much, and Brett was called out for using an illegal substance, suspending the game for 25 days.</p>
