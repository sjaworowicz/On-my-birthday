    <h3>July 24, 1983: New York Yankees vs Kansas City Royals “Pine Tar Incident”</h3>
    <p>On July 24, 2983, the New York Yankees were playing the Kansas City Royals when George Brett hit a home run while the royals trailing the game 4-3, making them have a 5-4 lead, then the Yankees manager decided for the umpires to check his bat. All the umpires gathered around and measured the bat to make sure the bat didn’t have too much pine tar (which helps players get a better grip of the bat). Once they measured the pine tar, there was too much, and Brett was called out for using an illegal substance, suspending the game for 25 days</p>
